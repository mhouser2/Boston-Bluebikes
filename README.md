# Boston Bluebikes Dashboard

[This Dashboard](https://boston-blue-bikes.herokuapp.com/) showcases data from Boston's Bluebikes ride-share program. Using trip data since 2020, this dashboard visualizes the most popular Bluebike stations, the relationship between stations, and exploratory data analysis on the program's history.

Trip data is publicly available [here](https://www.bluebikes.com/system-data). The data presented in the dashboard comes from a Postgresql database, which houses trip data and station information that has been transformed from the original data in order to improve database performance. The dashboard is built using Plotly Dash, and the maps are made with the help of Mapbox.
